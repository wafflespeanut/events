    In 2016, The Fifth Elephant branched into a separate conference on Deep Learning. Anthill Inside is the new avataar of the Deep Learning conference.
    Anthill Inside attempts to bridge the gap bringing theoretical advances closer to functioning reality. Proposals are invited for full length talks, crisp talks, and poster/demo sessions in the area of ML+DL. The talks need to focus on the techniques used, and may be presented independent of the domain wherein they are applied.
    We also invite talks on novel applications of ML+DL, and methods of realising the same in hardware/software.
    Case studies of how DL and ML have been applied in different domains will continue to be discussed at [The Fifth Elephant](https://fifthelephant.in).
